Pipe
--
An implementation of a `pipe` function that works with a mix of promises and non-promises.

`pipe` is a function that receives a list of functions and returns a new function that executes the given list from left to right passing the result from each previous function to the next. 

For example:
```js
const promiseToAddOne = async x => x + 1
const double = x => x * 2
const promiseToDouble = async x => x * 2
const addOneThenDoubleTwice = pipe(
    promiseToAddOne,
    double,
    promiseToDouble
)
addOneThenDoubleTwice(1).then(console.log) // logs 8
```
